pyROManager is a nds-rom management system written in python.

The project is still in a very early stage, however it is usable.
Some of the current features:
 - Rom database updates using ADVANsCEne (http://advanscene.com/) dat-files.
 - Automatic rom identification by crc, name or releaseid.
 - Archive support with multiple roms per archive.
    * You would need 7z and unrar binaries in your $PATH to use those types of archives
 - Savefiles backup and automatic upload with rom.
 - cli
